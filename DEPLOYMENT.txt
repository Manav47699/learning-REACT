# Hosting and deployment
-> VPS is better but C pannel is cheaper.
-> CI/CD (Contnious integrarion / contnious deployment) pipeline: 

VPS (free) : virtual private server. 
:For frontend: Vercel, Netlify
:For back end: Heroku (only permium now ðŸ¥±), Render, Railway (databse is also free of cost) 

C pannel(premium): this is cheaper than VPS premium. Eg: babbalhost , prabhuhost etc.



# PRACTICAL DEPLOYMENT ##
IMPORTANT: make a file "vercel.json" in your root directory and paste the following code before pushing to github.

{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}

THIS FIXES THE 404 error after refreshing.
-> sign up to vercel with your github account.
-> select a new repo and manage some settings such as root directery and framework etc
-> click deploy



# FOR DATABASE
-> for postgres : Supabase or just use railway.
