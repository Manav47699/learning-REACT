# july 18 2025, day 3: Learned components, using hyperlinks and hook/methods() [useState()]
-> componets: a building block in a site that can be used in any page of our project.
-> hyperlinks: href="/home"  [make sure you are using the same url in App.jsx
-> hooks: method() provided by REACT
-> useState(): used to store data . eg useState("manav") returns [name, setname()] i.e a variable to look at the content it stores and a function to manipulate that variable.
